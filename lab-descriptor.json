  "introduction": "The Electric Circuit Virtual Lab offers a comprehensive and interactive environment for students to explore foundational concepts in electrical circuits through simulation-based experimentation. Designed in alignment with undergraduate curricula in physics and electrical engineering, this virtual lab enables learners to visualize and analyze a wide variety of resistive, capacitive, and inductive circuits—both in series and parallel configurations—under AC and DC conditions.<br>Key theoretical models such as Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems, Kirchhoff’s laws, and resonance principles in RLC circuits are demonstrated through dynamic simulations, allowing for manipulation of circuit parameters and real-time observation of system behavior. This hands-on virtual experience enhances conceptual understanding, fosters problem-solving skills, and supplements traditional classroom and laboratory instruction without the constraints of physical equipment.",
